# FieldLord
FieldLord is a Java-based application that uses MySQL database to help field management in providing fields for rent. It has the following features:

Login and registration for renters : Renters can create an account and login to the application to search for fields, book fields, and view their booking history.

Account and dashboard for renters and providers : Renters and providers have their own accounts with their own dashboards. Renters can view their booking history, upcoming bookings, and messages from providers. Providers can view their fields, bookings, and messages from renters.

Field booking : Renters can search for fields by location, size, and price. Once they find a field they want to rent, they can book it by submitting a request. Providers will then review the request and approve or deny it.

Field schedule : Providers can create a schedule for their fields, indicating when the fields are available for rent. Renters can view the schedules of the fields they are interested in to make sure they are available when they need them.


FieldLord is a convenient and easy-to-use application that can help field management streamline the process of renting out fields. It is a valuable tool for both renters and providers, making it easier for them to find and book the fields they need.
